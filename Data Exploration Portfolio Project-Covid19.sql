--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- Select Data that we are going to be starting with:

SELECT Location, date, total_cases, new_cases, total_deaths, population
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE dea.continent IS NOT NULL AND dea.location IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 1) Total Cases vs Total Deaths -- Shows likelihood of dying if you contract covid in your country:

SELECT Location, date, total_cases,total_deaths, (total_deaths/total_cases)*100 AS DeathPercentage
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
WHERE location LIKE '%india%'
AND continent IS NOT NULL
ORDER BY 1,2

-- 2) Total Cases vs Population -- Shows what percentage of population infected with Covid:

SELECT Location, date, Population, total_cases,  (total_cases/population)*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--WHERE location like '%india%'
order by 1,2

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

-- 3) Countries with the Highest Infection Rate compared to Population:

SELECT Location, Population, MAX(total_cases) AS HighestInfectionCount,  MAX((total_cases/population))*100 AS PercentPopulationInfected
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths
--WHERE location LIKE '%india%'
GROUP BY Location, Population

-- 7) Total Population vs Vaccinations -- Shows Percentage of Population that has recieved at least one Covid Vaccine:

-- 9) Using Temp Table to perform Calculation on Partition By in previous query:


DROP Table if exists #PercentPopulationVaccinated
CREATE TABLE #PercentPopulationVaccinated
(
	Continent nvarchar(255),
	Location nvarchar(255),
	Date datetime,
	Population numeric,
	New_vaccinations numeric,
	RollingPeopleVaccinated numeric
)

INSERT INTO #PercentPopulationVaccinated

	AND dea.date = vac.date

--ORDER BY 2,3

SELECT *, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/Population)*100
FROM #PercentPopulationVaccinated

-- 10) Creating View to store data for later visualizations

CREATE VIEW PercentPopulationVaccinated 
AS
SELECT dea.continent, dea.location, dea.date, dea.population, vac.new_vaccinations
	, SUM(CONVERT(int,vac.new_vaccinations)) OVER (Partition BY dea.Location ORDER BY dea.location, dea.Date) AS RollingPeopleVaccinated
	--, (RollingPeopleVaccinated/population)*100
FROM PortfolioProject..CovidDeaths dea
JOIN PortfolioProject..CovidVaccinations vac
